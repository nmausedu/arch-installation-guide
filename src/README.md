# Introduction

This guide will walk you through the steps of installing the Arch Linux operating system.
Arch is highly customizable and a popular choice among Linux users.

Throughout this book, commands that you have to execute are marked in code blocks
with a dollar sign, like this:

```
$ ls
```
